Title
3D Spinning Object
Creator: Keigo Ma

This is a CSCE 654 GEOMETRIC MODELING Project. 

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a project that can display an object that will be spinning in a certain style and speed. 
For example, the object might be spinning around the x-axis with a speed rate of 5.

Problem
During the study of GEOMETRIC MODELING, the difficulty of imaging the 3D object is extremely high and time-wasting. Therefore, the program is intended to have a tool that can help students to study the course

Originality
I will be using C or C++ to write this program.

Goal
The program will accept the speed rate and the shape of the object, once the user input successfully, the program will start running and display the movement of the object.
